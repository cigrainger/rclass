We&amp;#8217;re really starting to pick up pace now, and if you want to be proficient in R, we can&amp;#8217;t slow down. As I said in class, I want to introduce you to ways of thinking that might be a little outside of your comfort zone, but which will get you a bit closer to thinking like a data&amp;nbsp;scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best things you can do, and what I would like you to do for homework, is read the (&amp;#8216;Tidy Data&amp;#8217;)[http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf] paper by Hadley Wickham. Hadley is one of the most prominent programmers in the R language, and his work is so integral to the day-to-day work of so many R users that his packages (like dplyr, reshape2, and ggplot2) are collectively known as the&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;Hadleyverse.&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like you to go ahead and try to do as much as you can of the project that we started in class today. Remember that you will need to set up git on your computer (instructions are in the previous post). You will then need to sign up to GitHub, follow me, fork the repository, open a version control project in RStudio, and save, commit, and push your work. I can then check on&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great opportunity for you guys to start getting your hands dirty and break past any inhibitions you have about Googling and experimenting. I don&amp;#8217;t expect you to know how to do everything in the homework yet, but you will need to be resourceful enough with the skills you have already gained to figure it out. You have a basic grasp of how R works. Searches like &amp;#8216;merging data in R&amp;#8217; will return rich explanations on websites like (Stack Overflow)[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r]. I have linked to a number of good resources in the Resources page&amp;nbsp;above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend that if you have any questions you ask them in the comments section of this post. Don&amp;#8217;t be discouraged if I respond with tips on how to find the answer yourself. This is part of programming and I have to reiterate that it is the only way to really learn. Programmers never really &amp;#8216;know&amp;#8217; everything by heart. You learn phrases and idioms, you learn intuition, but very often you will need to refer back to old code or check the documentation or just Google for how to do something. I use Google constantly in almost every project I work&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that we don&amp;#8217;t have class next week as it is reading week. I will put up another post to comment on progress with the homework and to guide you to some more resources. When we return (26/2), we&amp;#8217;ll finish up our coverage of basic data prep and start looking at visualisation.&lt;sup id="fnref:fn-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fn-1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a look ahead, start looking at ggplot2 (part of the &amp;#8216;Hadleyverse&amp;#8217; and one of the most important packages in R). I really recommend the (&amp;#8216;Graphs&amp;#8217; section of Cookbook for R)[http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/] as a starting point for ggplot2. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:fn-1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

If you haven&amp;#8217;t, you will need to in order to continue the class. You can find my profile &lt;a href="https://github.com/cigrainger"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a great deal of GitHub resources on the internet, so it doesn&amp;#8217;t make much sense to write a step-by-step guide. I would like you to familiarise yourself with GitHub and explore some of the code that is&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve found that this &lt;a href="http://kbroman.github.io/github_tutorial/"&gt;&amp;#8216;minimal tutorial&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt; is the best basic introduction to GitHub. There is a section on Git with RStudio and this is absolutely essential for the rest of the course. I will assume you have seen this and understand it in class next week. If you have questions, please ask them in the comments below. I have provided some further links to learning about Git and GitHub in the &amp;#8216;Resources&amp;#8217; section&amp;nbsp;above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting next week, I will be assigning homework by building a repository with some data and code. I would like you to &amp;#8216;fork&amp;#8217; the repo, make changes, and then commit your changes. I will then be able to check and comment on&amp;nbsp;these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, this week I would like you to complete the &lt;a href="http://tryr.codeschool.com/"&gt;Code School R Class&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-r"&gt;DataCamp exercises&lt;/a&gt;. These will reinforce what we have covered in the first two weeks so you will be ready as we move into more practical (and fast-paced)&amp;nbsp;content.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="R"></category><category term="class"></category><category term="admin"></category><category term="GitHub"></category></entry><entry><title>Welcome</title><link href="http://cigrainger.github.io/rclass/2014/01/welcome.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-01-12T11:20:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Christopher Grainger</name></author><id>tag:cigrainger.github.io/rclass,2014-01-12:2014/01/welcome.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the class. Over the next eleven weeks or so, you will learn how to use the R programming language for data analysis. My goal is to enable you to use R for your dissertation and to give you a skill you can use on the job market. As I will explain in the first class, this means more than just teaching you the R language. In this introductory post, I&amp;#8217;ll give you a few tips for getting started. Just to be clear, these things are foundational and required for the&amp;nbsp;course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of you have never used a programming language before, and it can be daunting. It&amp;#8217;s easy to fall into bad habits or to be frustrated or confused when first learning how to code. This is especially true when your first programming language is R. For reasons that will become clear in the coming weeks, it&amp;#8217;s very tempting to use R as a glorified &amp;#8216;command line interface&amp;#8217; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt;). And certainly we &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; use R in that way, but only some of the time. Most of the time we will be focusing on producing fully reproduceable, idiomatic R code.&lt;sup id="fnref:fn-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fn-1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things you can do at the beginning of this course is to get used to writing code in &amp;#8216;plain text&amp;#8217; files.&lt;sup id="fnref:fn-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fn-2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Set up a directory somewhere on your computer for use with this course (for reasons that will become clear later, don&amp;#8217;t set this up on Dropbox or in any other cloud folder). In that folder, you will save your code files, which will be in the &amp;#8216;.R&amp;#8217; file&amp;nbsp;format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days I will put up a post on how to get started with &lt;a href="https://github.com"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. GitHub is a web-based service for hosting code and developing software using the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)"&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; revision control system. What this allows you to do is maintain a history of all of the edits that you&amp;#8217;ve made to your code so you can always go back and fix it. It also allows us to work collaboratively, which will be part of the class. For example, I might ask you to &amp;#8216;fork&amp;#8217; a &amp;#8216;repository&amp;#8217; and make some changes to code. I will then be able to see your code and provide feedback. (Don&amp;#8217;t worry if this all sounds a bit confusing. It&amp;#8217;s very easy and I don&amp;#8217;t expect you to understand it just&amp;nbsp;yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, I&amp;#8217;ll just ask that you install R on your computer. You can get it &lt;a href="http://cran.r-project.org"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; under &amp;#8216;Download and Install&amp;nbsp;R&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this will be made easier by the use of &lt;a href="http://www.rstudio.com"&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt;, which is an &amp;#8216;integrated development environment&amp;#8217; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDE&lt;/span&gt;) for R. Please install that as well. It will make your life easier, I promise! And I will teach everything in this course within RStudio, while also making overt what is going on &amp;#8216;behind the scenes&amp;#8217; in terms of file management,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t worry too much about using R on your own computer before the class begins. If you&amp;#8217;d like to play around, you&amp;#8217;re welcome to do so. For example, R can work like a calculator: &lt;code&gt;1 + 1&lt;/code&gt; will return &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;. There are a couple of resources on the web for trying out R. These only take an hour or two and they&amp;#8217;re definitely worth a&amp;nbsp;go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://tryr.codeschool.com"&gt;Code School: Try&amp;nbsp;R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-r"&gt;Data Camp: Introduction to&amp;nbsp;R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just one last thing: comments are open on this site. Remember that they are public (so be smart about what you post), but they are a good way to get help or have discussion about the topics covered in the&amp;nbsp;class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing you all next&amp;nbsp;Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing &amp;#8216;idiomatic&amp;#8217; code means not just writing code that works, but code that follows best practices in terms of both understandability in the R community and optimising the performance of the code for R specifically. R is a bit of a funny language, especially since the vast majority of R &amp;#8216;users&amp;#8217; don&amp;#8217;t see themselves as R &amp;#8216;programmers&amp;#8217;. We&amp;#8217;ll be dismissing that false dichotomy. I&amp;#8217;ll post more on &amp;#8216;idiomatic R&amp;#8217; as this course goes on.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:fn-1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with plain text, a great primer is &lt;a href="http://www.linfo.org/plain_text.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:fn-2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
