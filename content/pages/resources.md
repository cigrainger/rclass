This is a list of links to resources for students on R for Energy Economics and Policy.

### Main resources
- [The R Project for Statistical Computing](http://www.r-project.org): Download R here. Some basic introductory information as well.
- [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com): This is an 'integrated development environment' (IDE) for R. We will be using it in this course.
- [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com): A 'best of' R blogs. Usually interesting.
- [idre at UCLA](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/): The Institute for Digital Research and Education at UCLA has a lot of very good resources for learning R. Some of the content is dated.
- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r): This is the best place to search for answers to your questions. If you can't find the answer here, you can also ask questions and people are very quick to respond.
- [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net): This is a very good 'quick reference' for R.
- [R Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com): Another very good reference site. This is particularly good for `ggplot2`.

### Online interactive R classes
