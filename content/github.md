Summary: How to get started with GitHub.

I hope that you all have signed up to [github.com](http://www.github.com) and followed me as I requested in the email. If you haven't, you will need to in order to continue the class. You can find my profile [here](https://github.com/cigrainger).

There are a great deal of GitHub resources on the internet, so it doesn't make much sense to write a step-by-step guide. I would like you to familiarise yourself with GitHub and explore some of the code that is available.

I've found that this ['minimal tutorial'](http://kbroman.github.io/github_tutorial/) is the best basic introduction to GitHub. There is a section on Git with RStudio and this is absolutely essential for the rest of the course. I will assume you have seen this and understand it in class next week. If you have questions, please ask them in the comments below. I have provided some further links to learning about Git and GitHub in the 'Resources' section above.

Starting next week, I will be assigning homework by building a repository with some data and code. I would like you to 'fork' the repo, make changes, and then commit your changes. I will then be able to check and comment on these.

As a reminder, this week I would like you to complete the [Code School R Class](http://tryr.codeschool.com/) and the [DataCamp exercises](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-r). These will reinforce what we have covered in the first two weeks so you will be ready as we move into more practical (and fast-paced) content.
